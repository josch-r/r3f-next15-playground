This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Additionally I installed @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei + leva to get you started using r3f with next15. 

For installation it could happen that you need to install via 
```bash
npm i --force
```

Happy coding :)
